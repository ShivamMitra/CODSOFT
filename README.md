## About the Project
CODSOFT brings together several Jupyter Notebook-based machine learning experiments, each focusing on classification problems with real (or realistic) datasets.  
The goals are:  
- To illustrate the end-to-end workflow of ML classification: data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.  
- To provide clean, reusable notebooks for learning or as starting points for further experiments.  
- To showcase techniques in a modular way, making it approachable for students or ML practitioners.

## Key Contents
This repository currently includes (but is not limited to) the following notebooks:  
- `credit-card-fraud-detection.ipynb` — Detect fraudulent transactions using classification models.  
- `movie-genre-classification.ipynb` — Classify movies by genre based on features (e.g., text or metadata).  
- `sms-spam-filter.ipynb` — Build a spam vs ham filter for SMS messages.

Each notebook contains:  
- A clear problem statement  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature processing/engineering  
- Model selection and training  
- Results evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC, etc.)  
- Discussion of results and next steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Common ML/data science libraries: e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, maybe `tensorflow` or `keras` depending on notebook.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/CODSOFT.git
   cd CODSOFT

2. Install required libraries. For example:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
(You may adjust this depending on the notebook’s needs.)

### Running Notebooks
- Launch Jupyter:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook

- Open the notebook of your choice (e.g., sms-spam-filter.ipynb) and run the cells step by step.
- Inspect outputs, make edits, experiment with different models or features.

## Usage
- Use the notebooks as learning resources: step through the code, tweak parameters, add more models.
- Use them as starter templates: for example, replace datasets or features for your own classification tasks.
- Extend them: add deeper EDA, advanced models (e.g., ensemble methods, deep learning), hyperparameter tuning, deployment.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, new classification tasks, better visualisations, or performance-tuning tips:
- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature)
- Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add …")
- Push to your branch (git push origin feature/YourFeature)
- Open a pull request describing your changes.
- Please ensure your code is well-documented and notebooks remain clear for users following along.
